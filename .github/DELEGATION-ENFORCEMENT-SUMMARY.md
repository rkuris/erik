# Delegation Enforcement Summary

## Changes Made

All chatmode personas have been updated with **explicit domain boundaries** and **mandatory delegation protocols** to prevent out-of-scope work attempts.

## Updated Files

### Core Configuration
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Added strict ownership rules and delegation protocol with examples
- `.github/DELEGATION-REFERENCE.md` - New quick reference guide for all personas

### Chatmode Personas
All chatmodes now include a `domain_boundaries_and_delegation` section:

1. **Backend-Developer.chatmode.md**
   - Owns: `nextgen/src`, `legacy/src`, backend tests
   - Must delegate: UI, build systems, docs, test plans, security reviews

2. **Frontend-Developer.chatmode.md**
   - Owns: `nextgen/webui/**`, client-side code
   - Must delegate: APIs, build systems, docs, test plans, security reviews

3. **DevOps-Engineer.chatmode.md**
   - Owns: `.github/workflows`, build tooling, OTA packaging
   - Must delegate: Application code, UI, docs, test code, security config

4. **QA-Test-Engineer.chatmode.md**
   - Owns: Test planning, test code, validation
   - Must delegate: Production code fixes, CI infrastructure, docs

5. **Web-Security.chatmode.md**
   - Owns: Security reviews, vulnerability assessment
   - Must delegate: ALL implementation (provides recommendations only)

6. **Project-Manager.chatmode.md**
   - Owns: `docs/**`, `README.md`, `.github/**` (non-code)
   - Must delegate: All code implementation and technical execution

7. **AI-Orchestrator.chatmode.md**
   - Enhanced coordination principles
   - Added enforcement responsibilities to detect and redirect misrouted work

## Key Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. STOP Protocol
Every persona MUST:
1. **STOP immediately** when encountering out-of-scope work
2. Identify what's blocked and who owns it
3. Provide context for handoff
4. Request user to retask appropriate persona
5. **Wait** - never proceed without delegation

### 2. Delegation Message Template
```
‚ö†Ô∏è DELEGATION REQUIRED

Task: [brief description]
Reason: Outside my domain ([your domain])

üëâ Please retask **[Target Persona]** to handle:
- [specific work items]

Context they'll need:
- [dependencies, requirements]

I cannot proceed with this work myself.
```

### 3. Visual Indicators
- ‚ö†Ô∏è emoji alerts for delegation requests
- üëâ emoji for clear action items
- Structured format for easy parsing

## Quick Reference Resources

Users can consult:
- `.github/DELEGATION-REFERENCE.md` - Complete reference with examples and red flags
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Workspace-level policy (lines 47-131)
- Individual chatmode files - Persona-specific boundaries

## Expected Behavior Changes

### Before
- Personas might attempt work outside their domain "because it's simple"
- Cross-domain work done without explicit handoff
- Unclear ownership boundaries

### After
- Immediate STOP when encountering out-of-scope work
- Explicit delegation request with context
- Clear ownership and accountability
- User-driven task routing between personas

## Testing the Changes

Try these scenarios to verify enforcement:

1. **Ask Backend Developer to modify UI**
   - Expected: STOP, delegate to Frontend Developer

2. **Ask Frontend Developer to add API endpoint**
   - Expected: STOP, delegate to Backend Developer with API contract

3. **Ask DevOps to fix application bug**
   - Expected: STOP, delegate to Backend/Frontend based on file location

4. **Ask Security Expert to implement fix**
   - Expected: Provide recommendations, delegate implementation to domain owner

5. **Ask Project Manager to write code**
   - Expected: STOP, delegate to appropriate technical persona

## Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ Zero instances of personas modifying files outside their domain
- ‚úÖ All cross-domain work explicitly delegated with user approval
- ‚úÖ Clear handoff communication between personas
- ‚úÖ Reduced scope creep and boundary violations

## Next Steps

1. Monitor persona behavior across several tasks
2. Collect examples of good delegation for documentation
3. Refine delegation templates based on usage patterns
4. Consider adding automation to detect file-level violations

## Rollback Plan

If the enforcement is too restrictive:
1. Restore from commit before delegation strengthening
2. Review specific friction points
3. Adjust boundary definitions or delegation protocol
4. Re-deploy with refined policies
